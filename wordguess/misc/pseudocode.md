    - Increment wrong guesses variable if wrong, start process over again
    - If correct, populate letter in word, start process over again
    - If 10 wrong guesses, end game and reveal word

- Things shown on screen:
    - Overall Score (Wins? W out of total games? 2-0, 3-1, etc. )
    - Wrong guesses
    - Dashes for word "_______", etc.  "_" get replaced with letters when guessed correctly
    - Letters guessed already - (if not in this array, else write guess/keypress here)
